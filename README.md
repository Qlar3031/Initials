A program that uses Beizer Curves to draw my initials on the screen made for uni assignment.
An additional functionality is the ability to preview and edit the position of points using the mouse and keyboard while the program is running
Controls:
Space - Allows you to turn on and off the visibility of control points on the screen
TAB - Allows you to turn on and off the visibility of control point coordinates (coordinates are visible only when points are also visible)
